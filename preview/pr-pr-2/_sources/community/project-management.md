## Project management

As a community manager, you might need to onboard contributors who may not contribute in technical ways.

- Send a personalized welcome message expressing gratitude and introducing the project.
- Provide an overview of the project's mission, values, and community culture.
- Highlight non-technical contribution opportunities like documentation, user support, translations, design, and community management.
- Create clear contribution guidelines with step-by-step instructions and templates.
- Maintain regular communication to share updates and opportunities.
- Recognize and appreciate all contributions, both technical and non-technical.
- Foster a welcoming and inclusive community environment.
- Ensure adherence to the project's code of conduct.

### OSS management (TODO)

- Overview of issues and PRs among several repositories
  - Reviewing PRs or assigning reviewers to the PRs
  - Solving the issues/responding to the issues
    - Responding - to maintain communication with the author
  - Closing stale PRs and old issues
  - Labelling issues
